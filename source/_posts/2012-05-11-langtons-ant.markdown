## Description

Langtonâ€™s Ant is a 4-state two-dimensional Turing machine invented
in the 1980s. The ant starts out on a grid containing black and
white cells, and then proceeds according to the following set of
rules:

1.  If the ant is on a black square, it turns right 90 degrees and
    moves forward one unit.
2.  If the ant is on a white square, it turns left 90 degrees and
    moves forward one unit.
3.  When the ant leaves a square, it inverts the color.
